abstract = {This extended abstract introduces James, a new tool for measuring how IPv6 Extension Headers (IPv6 EHs) are processed in the network. James sends specially crafted Paris traceroute packets between a set of controlled vantage points. Early measurement results show that IPv6 EHs may be dropped in the network, depending on their type and the size of the Extension Header.},

The limits described herein establish the minimum baseline of support for use of extension headers in the Internet. If it is known that all communicating parties for a particular commumication, including end hosts and any intermediate nodes in the path, are capable of supporting more than the baseline then these default limits may be freely exceeded.},
